  I aunderstood bu this paragraph 
“Difficult to make even small changes”

“Breaking functionality of the software by making changes”

“Introducing a new bug by fixing another one”

“Implementing code that is unnecessary”

“Almost impossible to add a new feature because of complicated code”

*The never-shipping product*

**Throwing code away and rewriting it from scratch**”**

the developoer want to cry becouse :
**To avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software. You should develop a mindset that every developer should have. This mindset will help you make better decisions in your daily programming journey. You can keep your software as simple as possible. You can protect it from being an unmanageable and complex system.**
